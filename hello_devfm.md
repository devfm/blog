What is it about?
--------------------
So what is devfm? Is it another music streaming app? Is it a podcast for developers? That would be some obvious guesses. "FM" is short for "Force Multiplier". Let's take a look at the definition from Google search results:

    A force multiplier refers to a factor that dramatically increases (hence "multiplies") the effectiveness of an item or group. 

There are more information from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_multiplication "force multiplication")

"dev" would be obviously referring to software development here. "devfm" is used here to refer to any tools, systems, and practices to make software development more efficient.

Why another name?
-----------------------
Different organizations use different names describing the team working on making development more efficient. You probably heard of "dev ops", "eng productivity", "dev infrastructure", etc. The names are missing the importance of the field. It does not justify the value of the team provide, and especially making people think they are not engineering works with "ops" type of wording in them.

"devfm" is a better name since it continuously reminds people the value of team provide.

What is included?
---------------------
So you might ask what is in the scope of the "devfm" field. One simple answer is that it includes everything around writing code except how to write code.

What is not in the scope might be easier:

 - How to write a web crawler in python
 - How to use inheritance in Java
 - ...

A non-exhausting list would look like:

 - What IDE to use, vim vs emacs? Eclipse vs IntelliJ?
 - What version control system? git vs mercurial? 
 - How to build?
 - How to package the application?
 - What continuous integration system to use?
 - What is the branching strategy?
 - How to keep track of features and bugs?
 - How to deploy the application? mobile, backend, database
 - How to do presubmit check?
 - How to do code review?
 - How to build a submit queue?
 - How to run integration test?
 - How to monitor the system?
 - How to get feedback, signals from different source to understand how app is working?
 - Train everyone use different tools, systems, understand process.
 
These are just some of the issues devfm should address. It is not close to be the full list.

One more thing
-------------------
One very important aspect of the devfm is it is not a group people doing manual work no one wants to do. It is about building great tools, systems, and optimizing process to empower everyone to be more efficient.
